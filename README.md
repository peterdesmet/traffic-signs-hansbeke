# Traffic signs of Hansbeke, Belgium

## Introduction

In my professional life, I standardize and publish datasets created by others, and try to convince them to publish these under an open licence. The goal of this project is to collect data myself and do the same. I am well aware this dataset is completely pointless (I was very bored when I started this), but in the meantime, I hope to learn some [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) and [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software). Also, it involves walking, which is healthy.

## Dataset

The [dataset is hosted on CartoDB](http://peterdesmet.cartodb.com/tables/1287/public#/table) and can be downloaded as `csv`, `shp`, `kml`, `svg` and `geojson`. The `csv`-file, sorted on `cartodb_id` is [versioned in this repository](data/traffic_signs_hansbeke.csv).

## Licence

The data are released to the public domain under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), meaning you don't need any permission to use these. I would be [glad to hear](https://twitter.com/peterdesmet) if you found a use for them though.
