# All traffic signs of Hansbeke, Belgium

## Introduction

The mission of this project is to have a well-documented and complete dataset of **pointless data**. My reasoning for this is a fondness for open data, an interest in learning [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) and [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software), and boredom. Also, it involves walking, which is healthy.

## Dataset

The [dataset is hosted on CartoDB](http://peterdesmet.cartodb.com/tables/1287/public#/table) and can be downloaded as `csv`, `shp`, `kml`, `svg` and `geojson`. The `csv`-file, sorted on `cartodb_id` is [versioned in this repository](traffic_signs_hansbeke.csv).
